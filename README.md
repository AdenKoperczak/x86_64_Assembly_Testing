# x86_64_Assembly_Testing
Just some testing and learning I have been doing in x86_64 assembly.

All of this code was assembled on the Ubnuntu Linux Subsystem for Windows. I make no guaranties that it will work there or anywhere else. It is 64 bit assembly, and my assembler of choise is nasm. I use gcc to link in most cases. See each README.md for more details on individual projects.
