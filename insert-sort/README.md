# Assembly Insert-Sort
This is an implementation of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort](insert-sort)
algorithm in x86_64 assembly. `insert_sort.asm` and `insert_sort.h` define a C
compatible function (insert_sort) which will sort a list using insert sort. 
main.c defines a main funciton which allows you to type out a list of integers 
to sort. insert_sort only works for integers
