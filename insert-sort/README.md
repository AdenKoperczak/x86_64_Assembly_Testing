# Assembly Insert-Sort
This is an implementation of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort](insert-sort)
algorithom in x86_64 assembly. insert_sort.asm and insert_sort.h define a C
compatable function (insert_sort) which will sort a list using insert sort. 
main.c defines a main funciton which allows you to type out a list of integers 
to sort. insert_sort only works for integers
